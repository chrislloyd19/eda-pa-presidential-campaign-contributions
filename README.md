## 2016 campaign contributions in Pennsylvania

In this project, I downloaded campaign contribution data from the FEC website and did some exploratory data analysis on it. For the most part, I looked at trends and features of how much and how often certain groups contributed to both parties and candidates. I learned some interesting insights into the electoral process, sharpened my skills with various R packages, and produced some cool plots along the way.
